# Speedster
A chrome extension to control playback speed using keyboad shortcuts on any website.

Alt + W to increase playback speed.
Alt + X to decrease playback speed.
Alt + Z to reset playback speed.

These shortcuts can be changed and there is no upper cap on the playback speed.
Shortcuts should be automatically assigned but, if not, you can assign them on the chrome extension page. You may need to restart Chrome to see the effect.
